=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Params::Registry;

    my $registry = Params::Registry->new(
        # express the global parameter sequence with an arrayref
        params => [
            {
                # see Params::Registry::Template for the full list of
                # attributes
                name => 'foo',
            },
        ],
        # specify groups containing potentially-overlapping subsets of
        # parameters for different aspects of your system
        groups => {
            stuff => [qw(foo)],
        },
        # override the name of the special 'complement' parameter
        complement => 'negate',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this module is to handle a great deal of the
housekeeping around sets of named parameters and their values,
especially as they pertain to web development. Modules like
L<URI::QueryParam> and L<Catalyst> will take a URI query string and
turn it into a HASH reference containing either scalars or ARRAY
references of values, but further processing is almost always needed
to validate the parameters, normalize them, turn them into useful
compound objects, and last but not least, serialize them back into a
canonical string representation. It is likewise important to be able
to encapsulate error reporting around malformed or conflicting input,
at both the syntactical and semantic levels.

While this module was designed with the web in mind, it can be used
wherever a global registry of named parameters is deemed useful.

=item Scalar

=item List

=item Tuple

A tuple can be understood as a list of definite length, for which each
position has its own meaning. The contents of a tuple can likewise be
heterogeneous.

=item Set

A standard mathematical set has no duplicate elements and no concept
of sequence.

=item Range

A range can be understood as a span of numbers or number-like objects,
such as L<DateTime> objects.

=item Object

=head3 Cascading

There are instances, for example in the case of supporting a legacy
HTML form, when it is useful to combine input parameters. Take for
instance the practice of using drop-down boxes for the year, month and
day of a date in lieu of support for the HTML5 C<datetime> form field,
or access to custom form controls. One would specify C<year>, C<month>
and C<day> parameters, as well as a C<date> parameter which
C<consumes> the former three, C<using> a subroutine reference to do
it. Consumed parameters are deleted from the set.

=head3 Complement

A special parameter, C<complement>, is defined to signal parameters in
the set itself which should be treated as complements to what have
been expressed in the input. This module makes no prescriptions about
how the complement is to be interpreted, with the exception of
parameters whose values are bounded sets or ranges: if a shorter query
string can be achieved by negating the set and removing (or adding)
the parameter's name to the complement, that is what this module will
do.

    # universe of foo = (a .. z)
    foo=a&foo=b&foo=c&complement=foo -> (a .. z) - (a b c)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiate a new parameter registry.

=item params

An C<ARRAY> reference of C<HASH> references, containing the specs to
be passed into L<Params::Registry::Template> objects.
